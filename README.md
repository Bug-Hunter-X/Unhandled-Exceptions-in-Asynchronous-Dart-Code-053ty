# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code: neglecting to properly handle exceptions within `async` functions.  The `bug.dart` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version.  The issue highlights the importance of robust error handling in asynchronous operations to prevent silent failures and enhance application stability.

## Problem

The original code lacks comprehensive exception handling in the `catch` block. This can lead to the application not responding as expected or failing silently, making debugging difficult. 

## Solution

The solution file, `bugSolution.dart`, improves error handling by:

1. Providing more informative error messages.
2. Considering logging the error to facilitate debugging.
3. Implementing logic to handle the exception appropriately based on context. This could include retrying the network request, displaying a user-friendly error message, or gracefully degrading the application's functionality.

This example showcases best practices for managing exceptions in asynchronous Dart applications and underlines the value of thorough exception management for a robust and reliable application.
